"""Define run-wide training-token capture settings.

```yaml
env:
  nemo_gym:
    token_id_capture:
      enabled: true
      dir: /tmp/ng_tokcap                  # The writer and consumer share this node-local directory.
      sink: my_pkg.sinks:MyDataPlaneSink   # This optional sink replaces the file store.
```

Evaluation capture uses ``/ng-rollout/<id>/...``.
Training capture uses ``/ng-rollout/<id>/training-token-capture/...``.
Training capture records token ids and log probabilities.
Evaluation capture records request and response summaries.
A run can enable either path independently.
Training capture applies through the static agent flag or run-level ``all_agents``.
Native agents normally leave the static flag disabled.
Their responses already carry token ids.
The top-level ``model_call_capture_dir`` is the fallback file-store directory.

Choosing where records go
-------------------------
``sink`` names a class implementing ``TokenSink``, as ``module.path:ClassName``.
Each server process constructs its sink at app startup.
A configured sink replaces the file store.
The paired ``source`` implements ``TokenSource`` for consumers.
Consumers call ``TokenSource.freeze`` to obtain an atomic snapshot.
Consumers retire that exact snapshot with its ``snapshot_id`` and version.
There is no HTTP token reader.
Uvicorn workers use spawned processes.
They do not inherit a sink installed by a launcher.
Configure the sink here so each worker builds its own.
Programmatic installation must occur inside the serving process.
