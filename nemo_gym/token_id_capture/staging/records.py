"""Staging wire shapes (gate-authoritative capture; single definition).

These are the records the token-in/token-out pipeline moves between the
inference worker, the framework's ``StagingSink`` (staging storage), the gate,
and the RL controller. They extend #2124's ``TokenEntry`` world: ``TokenEntry``
(``token_id_capture/records.py``) remains the read-route record rebuilt for
trainers; the shapes below are what travels while a rollout is in flight.
Shapes freeze at the S1 review gate; the optional ``chain_hash``/``cum_hash``
fields are reserved so the hardening layer (H2) is purely additive.

This module is part of the dependency-free capture core (the ``staging``
subpackage purity rule): stdlib + pydantic only.
