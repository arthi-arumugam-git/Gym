"""The protocols an RL framework implements to host gate-authoritative capture.

Gym owns the invariant -- lineage custody, the wire schema (``records.py``),
the digest, and rebuild semantics. A framework integrates by providing four
small implementations against this module:

* ``StagingSink`` -- WHERE staged deltas go (NeMo-RL: a TransferQueue partition).
* ``StagingSource`` -- the finalizer's read-back of staged rows by key.
* ``WeightVersionProvider`` -- the trainer-owned weight version for per-call
  tagging.
* one ``install_capture(...)`` call at worker startup.

Staging keys are opaque to Gym: TQ keys, file paths, and redis keys are all
valid. Conformance is tested, not trusted -- every framework implementation
runs the golden fixtures in ``conformance/``.

Namespacing note: these protocols are named ``StagingSink``/``StagingSource``
(not ``TokenSink``/``TokenSource``) because the base capture core already
exports ``TokenSink``/``TokenSource`` from ``nemo_gym.token_id_capture`` --
entry-based protocols over complete ``TokenEntry`` records. The staging
protocols carry *deltas* (``StagedCallRecord``) with digests and weight
versions; the rename keeps the two seams impossible to confuse.

This module is part of the dependency-free capture core: stdlib + pydantic
(via ``records``) only.
