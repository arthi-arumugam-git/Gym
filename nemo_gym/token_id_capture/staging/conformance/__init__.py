"""The installable conformance kit: golden call sequences -> byte-exact records.

Every framework's ``TokenSink``/``TokenSource`` implementation and every
engine adapter runs these fixtures in its own CI (see ``kit.py``); the same
fixtures are replayed through the gate in S3 and must produce byte-identical
manifests. Conformance is tested, not trusted.
